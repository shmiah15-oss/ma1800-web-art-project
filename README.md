My web-art project is about recreating the chaos and confusion that people experience while navigating the web/the internet.



Explaination of each page:

For page one, I've decided to make a page featuring an overwhelimg about of text, to stimulate the struggles of having to take in a lot of information at once, especially for those that are dyslexic or have a low reading age. It is meant to be under the guise of being a helpful guide for the internet but is in reality completely useless.  

Page two is meant to represent the concept of people having to memorises a lot of passwords if they wish to make an account on a website, and also represent the concept of having a lot of tabs open. Both concepts create confusion and chaos over trying to trying to navigate the web as memorising a lot of passwords is difficult and is easy to forget, while having a lot tabs open makes it difficult to know which one is the correct one to click on.

The third page is about creating false hope, it's meant to represent the concept that a lot of websites in fact lack accessibility for disabled people, thus no audio version is available under the illustion that it is an option in the first place.

Th fourth page is meant to represent the idea of misinformation about the internet, and about how clicking on unknown links can lead you to anywhere on the internet, even to webs that are not secure.

The fifth page, is about the stuggles of students trying to find information on the internet for their studies, but either finding too much information, too little or not being able to access it. The use of the bright coloured background it meant to bring in a sense of unprofessionalism. 

The sixth page is meant to represent how not all webs are secure are safe to use.



Structure:

Once you enter one of the pages from the index, you will not have access to the index page anymore, as the linked pages are completely randomised. This is to recreate the confusion that people experience when having to navigate through a wesite but not knowing where to go to find the source of information that they need.


Struggles:

I did have a few problems with hover effect in the index page - I did a small misspelling on containter for the audio image/link, which took me a while to notice.


Reflections:

Inspirations/references:
- Douglas Davis (1994) - https://artport.whitney.org/collection/DouglasDavis/live/Sentence/sentence1.html, the overwhelming content is what helped to create my idea for page 1.

- JODI (1996) - https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org 

- Heath Bunting (1997) - https://www.irational.org/_readme.html.
 
 (the fourth page was inpspired by both JODI and Bunting due the the large amounts of random hyperlinks that help to stimulate confusion)

 (The inspiration for page 5, I was particularly interested in the layout.)
